# IDE Integration

AiderDesk is designed to work seamlessly with your favorite Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Through dedicated plugins and extensions, you can automatically sync the files you are working on with AiderDesk's context, creating a fluid and efficient workflow.

## Supported IDEs

### Visual Studio Code

- **Extension**: [AiderDesk Connector on Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hotovo-sk.aider-desk-connector)
- **Source Code**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/hotovo/aider-desk-connector-vscode-extension)

The VSCode extension automatically adds the currently active file in your editor to the AiderDesk context. When you switch to a different file, it replaces the previous one, ensuring the AI's focus is always on your current task.
